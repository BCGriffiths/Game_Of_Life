A simple implementation of Conways Game of Life with a glider spawning in the top left corner of the plane.

I did this mostly as an experiment in console output with while loops and using a macro to detect the operating system.
The file should compile on Windows when using MinGW and on linux using gcc with "g++ main.cpp -o main".
